Welcome to CakeManager documentation!
=====================================

Introduction
------------
You are using CakePHP because you want to build web-applications. What does every web-application need? You always need a admin-section to manage all data. And, of course you need a login-system. Sometimes only for the admin-section, and sometimes for the whole application. The admin-section and login costs much time, but it should not be!
Second, you want to manage your data (like users, roles, posts, settings) easily. You don't want to spend much time at this.

The CakeManager offers a default login-system, and a strong admin-section to manage your application. You can manage your roles, members, settings, and the most important part: your own data!

The CakeManager is able to communicate with many plugins. We are working on some to make developing faster.
