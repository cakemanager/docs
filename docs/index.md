Welcome to CakeManager documentation!
=====================================

[doc_toc]

Introduction
------------

You are using CakePHP because you want to build web-applications. What does every web-application need? You always need a admin-section to manage all data. And, of course you need a login-system. The admin-section and login costs much time, but it should not be!

The CakeManager offers a default **login-system**, and a strong **admin-section to manage your application**. You can manage your roles, members, settings, and the most important part: your own data!

The CakeManager is able to communicate with many plugins. We are working on some to make developing faster.

Wanna read more? Read the [Quick Start tutorial](docs/1.0/tutorials-and-examples/quick-start/) to see how easy the plugin works!
