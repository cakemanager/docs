Installation
============

This section gives a brief description how to install the CakeManager and it's requirements.

[doc_toc]

Requirements
------------

- A fresh copy of CakePHP 3.x
- Composer

Getting the CakeManager
-----------------------

    "require": {
        "cakemanager/cakephp-cakemanager":  "~1.0"
    }

Each time you run php composer.phar update you will receive the latest stable releases when using the default version constraint ~1.0. Only bugfix and minor version releases of 1.x will be used when updating.

If you want to keep current with the latest unreleased changes in the CakeManager you can add the change your applicationâ€™s composer.json:

    "require": {
        "cakemanager/cakephp-cakemanager":  "dev-master"
    }

Be aware that is not recommended, as your application can break when next major version is being released. Additionally composer does not cache development branches, so it slows down consecutive composer installs/updates.

After that we need to load our plugin.
Use your shell...

    $ bin/cake plugin load Utils
    
    $ bin/cake plugin load -b -r CakeManager
    
... or use your `config/bootstrap.php`:

    Plugin::load('CakeManager', ['bootstrap' => true, 'routes' => true]);
    Plugin::load('Utils');

Creating the tables
--------------------

    $ bin/cake migrations migrate -p CakeManager
    
This command tells the Migrations-plugin to migrate (install) the CakeManager. This will load our tables.

Loading the roles and user
-----------------
Run the following commands in your command prompt:

    $ bin/cake manager initialize roles
    
This command creates the default roles of the CakeManager:

- Administrators
- Moderators
- Users
- Unregistered

Via this command you are able to create the first user:

    $ bin/cake manager user
    

Adding the components
--------------------
You have to load the following components: 

        public function initialize() 
        {
            $this->loadComponent('CakeManager.Manager');
            $this->loadComponent('Utils.Authorizer');
            $this->loadComponent('Utils.Menu');
        
            // used for the default index-page of CakePHP.
            // this will allow a non-logged user.
            $this->Auth->allow(['display']);
        }
