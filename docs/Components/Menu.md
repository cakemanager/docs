Menu-Component
==============

The Menu-Component allows us to create dynamic menu's for multiple areas.
The MenuComponent is default loaded by the CakeManager. Load the component with the following code:

    public function initialize() {
        // code
        $this->loadComponent('CakeManager.Menu');
    }
Configuring Component

Using the component
-------------------

### Areas
A web-page can contain multiple areas for menu's. Think about a main-area, a header, and a footer.
The menu-items for the Menu-Component are stored in a specific area.

An area can be set via: 

    $this->Menu->area('MyArea');

To get the current area (string) you can use:

    $this->Menu->area();

    
### Adding items
An example of adding an item:

    $this->Menu->add('Bookmarks', [
            'id'  => 'App.Bookmarks',
            'url' => [
                'plugin'     => false,
                'prefix'     => false,
                'controller' => 'bookmarks',
                'action'     => 'index'
            ]
    ]);

The first parameter is default the title of the item.

The second parameter is an array of settings. 

- id            - You can add an id to your item. This can be usefull for controlling the item, like editing, or deleting it's item.
- url           - Adding an url is just like CakePHP: adding an array or string.
- parent        - Not supported yet... This can be used for adding items under items.
- title         - The title can also be set via this setting. This is needed when you use the first parameter as ID.
- weight        - This is a value to order your items. If you add a specific item after another, but give it a lower integer (weight is default `10`), it will be sorted above the other item.
- icon          - Sometimes you want to add icons (like font-awesome). You can add icons via this setting.
- area          - Changing the area can also via this setting.
- active        - This setting is default set to false; and will automatically be set to true if the given url is equal to the current url. The helpers will be able to read this and react on it.

Note: Sub-items (adding a parent) is not supported yet...

### Removing items
You can remove items using it's id:

    $this->Menu->remove('Bookmarks');


Using the menu-data
-------------------

The component creates an variable `$menu` for your view. This variable is an array with the area's as keys.
If you select a key, you have an array of all items with the ID as key and options as data.

### Helpers
There are no helpers available yet to easy generate menu's from its data.

### Admin-section
For the Admin-section you can use the follwing in your view: 
    
    $this->Menu->menu('main');
